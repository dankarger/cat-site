# Mr Cat Site 
##This site is an exercise project

this exercise was part of "AppleSeed" fullstack bootcamp course 
And was a weekend assignment.
(The content is made up and serve for learning purposes only).
I tried to use what I learn in the course so far (HTML and CSS).

Part of the assigment was to deploy the site on netlify:
